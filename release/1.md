# Go version 1 is released

## 摘要

1. 28 March 2012 golang正式发布
2. the specification of the language
3. the specification of a set of core APIs
4. stability
    - 确保Go 1的各种基本功能和特性在未来的很长的一段时间内，都保持可用
    - Forward compatibility. code可以在未来任何Go 1.x上进行编译和运行
    - 向前兼容是指对未来版本的预期，向后兼容是对之前版本支持的实际情况
5. Compatibility is at the source level.
   Binary compatibility for compiled packages is not guaranteed between releases.
6. 实现了两个Go compilers: 'gc' and 'gccgo'.
7. Google App Engine SDK
8. the Go toolchain (compilers, linkers, build tools, and so on) is under active development and may change behavior
9. Code in sub-repositories of the main go tree, such as golang.org/x/net, may be developed under looser compatibility requirements.
   However, the sub-repositories will be tagged as appropriate to identify versions that are compatible with the Go 1 point releases.

## gc VS gccgo

参见[这里](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25811445/what-are-the-primary-differences-between-gc-and-gccgo)

1. Gc is the original compiler, and the go tool uses it by default.
   Gccgo is a different implementation with a different focus
2. Compared to gc, gccgo is slower to compile code but supports more powerful optimizations,
   so a CPU-bound program built by gccgo will usually run faster.
3. The gc compiler supports only the most popular processors: x86 and ARM
   gccgo: more optimization, more processors.
4. gccgo only supports up to version go v1.2, so if you need anything new in 1.3 / 1.4 (tip) gccgo cant be used.
   gccgo编译器版本的发布时间与Go的发布时间是独立的.
5. Go 1.5. The compiler and runtime are now written entirely in Go (with a little assembler).
   C is no longer involved in the implementation, and so the C compiler that
   was once necessary for building the distribution is gone.
6. go build -compiler gccgo myprog

## [Go 1 and the Future of Go Programs](https://golang.org/doc/go1compat)

在未来，Go 1.x 可能引起向后兼容风险的点:

1. Security
2. Unspecified behavior
3. Specification errors
4. Bugs
5. Struct literals
6. Methods
7. Dot imports
8. Use of package unsafe
9. No guarantee can be made about the performance of a given program between releases.
10. syscall不保证向后兼容

### The syscall package

syscall package面临以下问题：

1. Bloat. 操作系统接口众多；大量操作系统，同时使用了不同的架构. 而且接口还在不停的增长.
2. syscall没有进行明确的测试，也没有进行跨平台测试.
3. The package is the worst maintained, worst tested, and worst documented package
   in the standard repository, and continues to worsen.
4. the package does not meet the Go 1 compatibility guarantee

解决办法如下：

1. package syscall继续保留，但是采取freeze the package as of Go 1.3.
2. The syscall package will not be updated in future releases.
   即使是已有的接口，当操作系统的接口发生变动时，也不会更新
3. A new subrepository, go.sys, will be created.
4. The documentation for the standard syscall package will direct users to the new repository.
5. We propose to complete these changes before the September 1, 2014 deadline for Go 1.4.
