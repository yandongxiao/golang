# Go 1.7 is released

There are several significant changes in this release

- compiler improvements
- the addition of the context package
- support for hierarchical tests and benchmarks
- 170 people contributed to this release, including 140 from the Go community.

## compiler improvements

- static single-assignment(SSA)
- By representing a program in SSA form, a compiler may perform advanced optimizations more easily.
- users have observed a significant speedup in compile time and a reduction in binary size by as much as 20–30%.
- We observed a 5–35% speedup across our benchmarks[https://golang.org/test/bench/go1/] 编译、二进制、运行时间均有提升
- Programs should run a bit faster due to speedups in the garbage collector and optimizations in the standard library.
