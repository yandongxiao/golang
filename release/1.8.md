# Go 1.8 is released

There are significant performance improvements and changes across the standard library.

- The compiler back end introduced in Go 1.7 for 64-bit x86 is now used on all architectures
- Compile times should be improved by about 15% over Go 1.7.
- Garbage collection pauses should be significantly shorter
    - usually under 100 microseconds and often as low as 10 microseconds. 通常情况下
    - 在内存量很大的情况下，也是低于1ms. 18Gbyte heap
- The HTTP server adds support for HTTP/2 Push, allowing servers to preemptively send responses to a client.
- It's now much simpler to sort slices using the newly added Slice function in the sort package.


## Changes to the language

- When explicitly converting a value from one struct type to another, as of Go 1.8 the tags are ignored.
- Thus two structs that differ **only in their tags** may be converted from one to the other.

```
func example() {
	type T1 struct {
		X int `json:"foo"`
	}
	type T2 struct {
		X int `json:"bar"`
	}
	var v1 T1
	var v2 T2
	v1 = T1(v2) // now legal
}
```
