# Go 1.9 is released

- There are many changes to the language, standard library, runtime, and tooling.
- 24 August 2017
- This post covers the most significant visible ones.
- The most important change to the language is the introduction of type aliases. type T1 = T2
- The sync package has added a new Map type, safe for concurrent access.
- The new Helper method, added to both testing.T and testing.B
  When the testing package prints file and line information, it shows the location of the call
  to a helper function instead of a line in the helper function itself.
- The time package now transparently tracks monotonic time in each Time value
- Go 1.9 compiles functions in a package concurrently.
