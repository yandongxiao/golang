# Go 1.9 is released

## Abstract

- There are many changes to the language, standard library, runtime, and tooling.
- Most of the engineering effort put into this release went to improvements of the runtime and tooling. 工作重点
    - The most important change to the language is the introduction of type aliases. type T1 = T2
    - The sync package has added a new Map type, safe for concurrent access.
        - cache contention: when each core updates the count, it invalidates the local cache entries for that address in all the other ocres, and mark itself as the owner of the up-to-date value
        - the next core to update the count must fetch the value that the previous core wrote to its cache(CPU的缓存). 
        - that takes about 40ns.
        - 多个core同时写同一个地址，导致最后比一个core负责写还要慢, O(N)的时间复杂度.
        - It is not the best possible concurrency map for all use-cases.
            - stable keys
            - disjoint sotres. 即不同的core写入的是不同的key. 进一步，write once，read many times
            - concurrent loops. concurrent代表多协程写，loop表示每个协程都有很多的write操作.
            - 满足以上三种情况下，sync.Map才是最好的选择

    - The new Helper method, added to both testing.T and testing.B.
        - **Marks** the calling function as a test helper function
        - When the testing package prints file and line information, it shows the location of the call to a helper function instead of a line in the helper function itself.
    - The time package now **transparently** tracks monotonic time in each Time value.
        - 时间单调递增
        - elapsed := time.Since(start): this code now computes the right elapsed time even across a leap second clock reset
    - The Go compiler now supports compiling a package's functions in parallel
        - This is in addition to the go command's existing support for parallel compilation of separate packages. package之间的并行编译早已支持
    - GC
        - Library functions that used to trigger stop-the-world garbage collection now trigger concurrent garbage collection.
        -  runtime.GC, debug.SetGCPercent, and debug.FreeOSMemory, now trigger concurrent garbage collection, blocking only the calling goroutine until the garbage collection is done.
        - Large object allocation performance is significantly improved in applications using large (>50GB) heaps containing many large objects.
    - Moved GOROOT: GOROOT无需再提前设置

## Floating-point operators

```
// FMA allowed for computing r, because x*y is not explicitly rounded:
r  = x*y + z
r  = z;   r += x*y
t  = x*y; r = t + z
*p = x*y; r = *p + z
r  = x*y + float64(z)

// FMA disallowed for computing r, because it would omit rounding of x*y:
r  = float64(x*y) + z
r  = z; r += float64(x*y)
t  = float64(x*y); r = t + z
```

总结：如果要保持精度，就直接使用x*y+z的方式.

```
To force the intermediate rounding, write float64(x*y) + z.
```

## Codebase Refactoring

### 代码重构的几个原因

1. The first reason is to split a package into more manageable pieces for users. 避免代码膨胀
2. The second reason is to improve naming. 抽象出更小的package，代码量越小，package内部命名越准确
3. The third reason is to lighten dependencies. 代码量越小，依赖的package就越少.
4. The fourth reason is to change the dependency graph so that one package can import another. 因为Go不允许有循环依赖

### 代码重构的步骤

1. First, introduce the new API. **interchangeable** with old API(上层应用最好能够无感知的迁移；两种数据类型可以互相操作)
2. Second, across as many commits as you need, convert all the uses of the old API to the new API.
3. Third, remove the old API.

相比atomic code repair, 分步骤重构的风险更低

在package之间移动常量，变量，函数都是可以的，都能保持interchangeable属性；唯独type不行。
因为type INT int的定义中，INT和int是两种不同的类型；它们尚可通过强制类型转换，保持interchangeable。但是struct是绝对不可能的

这也是type INT = int语法的由来
