## Go, Open Source, Community

### do less, enable more

- Author: Russ Cox(and Rob Pike), tech lead of the go project and the go team at google.
- How I see the go project as a whole, and base on that explain how I see the go open source project evolving.
- two overarching goals: 1. scalable concurrency for cloud software; 2. go for collaboration(go for open source) to meet the challenges of scalable software development.
- go keywords: routines, channels, interfaces, fast builds, go command, to tools
- the goal balance: do less, enable more. go is not designed to resove everything; go has its own strengths; build foundations on these things for reuse
- the size of the go language itself: put in as few as possible mutually incomprehensible dialects; easy to learn and understand
- channels and goroutines: located at a level between mutex/condition and openMP, expect to handle most of the problems developer may encounted, not all.
- type: go is a static compiled language, but used as dynamicly as possible.
- interface: no implements hierachy like java, make it more flexible.
- testing and Benchmarking: provide most basic concept necessaryly to create a shared vocabulary so that higher-level toolings can interoperate.

### A Practical Guide to Preventing Deadlocks and Leaks in Go

- CSP: Communicating, Sequential, Processes
	- C: Communicate by passing messages.
	- S: these processes then executed Sequentially. We try to avoid concurrency in a process itself
	- P: what is processes.
		- a process is not a type. designing CSP is not the same as designing OO.
		- it's about inputs , outputs and pieces of execut steps, and the input and output have types.
		- like vending machine, input is a coin, ouput is some kind of food. no attribute about processes.
		- Designing with processes, not a single process.

- Tips for CSP design:
  1. Data flow. Focus on the flow of data, not the flow of control.
  2. Drawing.
  3. Piplines
  4. Exiting
