# Go 1.6 is released

Although the release of Go 1.5 six months ago contained dramatic implementation changes, this release is more incremental.

- The most significant change is support for HTTP/2 in the net/http package.
    - In Go 1.6, support for HTTP/2 is enabled by default for both servers and clients when using HTTPS
- The runtime has added lightweight, best-effort detection of concurrent misuse of maps.
    - If one goroutine is writing to a map, no other goroutine should be reading or writing the map concurrently.
    - If the runtime detects this condition, it prints a diagnosis and crashes the program.(这个狠)
- Garbage-collection pauses are even lower than with Go 1.5, but this is particularly noticeable for programs using large amounts of memory.
- Go 1.5 introduced experimental support for a “vendor” directory that was enabled by an environment variable. In Go 1.6, the feature is now enabled by default.

## cgo

The major change is the definition of rules for sharing Go pointers with C code, to ensure that such C code can coexist with Go's garbage collector.
