# Go 1.6 is released

Although the release of Go 1.5 six months ago contained dramatic implementation changes, this release is more incremental.

- The most significant change is support for HTTP/2 in the net/http package.
- In Go 1.6, support for HTTP/2 is enabled by default for both servers and clients when using HTTPS
- The runtime has added lightweight, best-effort detection of concurrent misuse of maps.
  If the runtime detects this condition, it prints a diagnosis and crashes the program.(这个狠)
- Performance of Go programs built with Go 1.6 remains similar to those built with Go 1.5.
- Garbage-collection pauses are even lower than with Go 1.5, but this is particularly noticeable for programs using large amounts of memory.
- With regard to the performance of the compiler tool chain, build times should be similar to those of Go 1.5.
