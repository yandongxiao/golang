# Go 1.11 is released

- two features stand out as being especially exciting: modules and WebAssembly support
    - modules: preliminary support, experimental phase
    - WebAssembly: experimental phase
        -  This allows programmers to compile Go programs to a binary format compatible with four major web browsers.
        - firefox, chrome, solaris, ie


- WebAssembly
    - 并不是一门编程语言，而是一份字节码标准，需要用高级编程语言编译出字节码放到 WebAssembly 虚拟机中才能运行(Go --> WebAssembly字节码 --> 主流浏览器支持WebAssembly VM)
    - WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine.
    - Wasm is designed as a portable target for compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

- release notes
    - The runtime now uses a sparse heap layout so there is no longer a limit to the size of the Go heap (previously, the limit was 512GiB).
