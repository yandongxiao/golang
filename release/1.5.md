# Go 1.5 is released

This release includes significant changes to the implementation.

## 摘要

1. The compiler and runtime are now written entirely in Go (with a little assembler).
   C is no longer involved in the implementation, and so the C compiler that was once necessary for building the distribution is gone.
   在1.4版本中，大部分run time相关的代码由go语言重构（e.g. 堆栈管理器，垃圾回收管理器，并发管理等）
2. The garbage collector was completely redesigned. The garbage collector is now concurrent and provides dramatically
   lower pause times by running, when possible, in parallel with other goroutines.
   The "stop the world" phase of the collector will almost always be under 10 milliseconds and usually much less.
3. Related improvements to the scheduler allowed us to change the default GOMAXPROCS value. in prior releases it defaulted to 1, 现在是CPU的核数
4. Changes to the linker enable building Go packages into archives or shared libraries that may be linked into or loaded by C programs
5. a standard mechanism for managing dependencies in Go programs. 尚处于实验阶段
6. The new "go tool trace" command enables the visualisation of  program traces.
7. language change: the lifting of a restriction in the map literal syntax.


## The Implementation

### No more C
